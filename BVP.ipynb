    "# Boundary Value Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "I will work through the basic approach to solving a boundary value problem (BVP) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  Assuming a second order ODE for the variable $y(t)$, an *initial value problem* (IVP) specifies values for $y$ and $dy/dt$ at $t=t_{0}$.  A BVP instead specifies values for $y$ at times $t=t_{0}$ and $t=t_{1}$ which we will label $y_{0}$ and $y_{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we still need to solve the ODE, which requires an initial value for $dy/dt$, which we have to guess (or at best estimate) and then vary.  The only available general approach to solving BVPs computationally is to perform a root search: we need to find the zeros of the quantity $y(t_{1}) - y_{1}$ as we vary $\\frac{dy}{dt}(t_{0})$.  The actual process is (relatively) straightforward; it's just understanding how it works that may be complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a simple manual search, and then show how to automate it.  We'll consider the problem of calculating the height, $z$, of a projectile (say a ball of some kind) moving under the influence of gravity, and we will simply specify that the height of the ball at both times $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$ should be zero; the ball is not constrained (i.e. there is no ground to hit, to avoid the trivial solution $z=0\\, \\forall \\,t$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the ODE solver\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that there is only motion in the $z$ direction, we have the following pair of coupled equations:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = v$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = -g$$\n",
    "where we will assume the standard value $g = 9.81ms^{-2}$.  The first thing to do is set up a function to return the right-hand sides of these coupled equations as a single array."

The return object (`y0` in the code below) stores positions and velocities in the array `y` for all timesteps; we access the position or velocity with the first index, and the timestep with the second index.  As we want the position and the final time, we use `y[0,-1]`. Let's assume a possible but not very sensible first velocity, $v_{0}=0.0$, and see what happens:"
